# Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository!

Hello! This is where I keep all my data science projects. 

Feel free to check out the projects and see what I've been working on â€“ each project has its own repository right here.

I'll be updating it regularly with new projects as I continue to learn and explore.

## 1. [EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/vilmahietala/data_science_projects/tree/master/EDA)

 * Description: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) that focuses on understanding the data and exploring the key factors that cause obesity.

## 2. [Titanic - Machine Learning](https://github.com/vilmahietala/data_science_projects/tree/master/titanic_competition_kaggle)


  * Description: The project predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
  * Technologies Used: Implemented a voting classifier that combines predictions from multiple models.
  * Results: Achieved a mean accuracy of 77.90% during testing phase.
