# EDA - Obesity Risk
Using a dataset from a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e2/data) to draw insights of the factors that cause obesity. 

The datasets for the competition were generated from a deep learning model trained on the [Obesity or CVD risk dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindpcoder/obesity-or-cvd-risk-classifyregressorcluster/data) 
The original dataset consists of the estimation of obesity levels in people from the countries of Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, with the ages between 14 and 61 years old. The people had diverse eating habits and physical conditions. The data was collected using a web platform with an anonymous survey.
## Methods

1. Data Exploration
2. Statistical Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Removing outliers
5. Visualization

## Findings

- Women had slightly higher mean BMI than men.
- Women had drastically more individuals with Obesity Type 3 than men.
- In the men's category obesity type 2 was the most common weight category, and as the second came Overweight Level 1.
- The highest correlation between BMI (after the weight column and target column) was a family history of overweight.
- Smoking didn't have a huge difference in the obesity level - there was not a lot of smokers.
- Consuming high calorie food increased the obesity level.
- Individuals with normal weight tended to have a higher frequency of physical activities.
